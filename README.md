# with-router
A pub-sub alternative HOC to `react-router`'s `withRouter` HOC. It functions exactly the same way, except the wrapped component will re-render when the route changes. This is beneficial if your view changes depending on the current path.

## Install
* `npm install with-router --save` or
* `yarn add with-router`

## Use
Use it the same way you would use `react-router`'s built-in `withRouter` HOC!
